# Global modules

These way to install the modules can help to add programs that will not be need it as local and we can assume that will be provided by the node 

## Example
Also we see how to make that the project restarts automatically when a change occurs in the code installing in a global way the module nodemon

```bash
node install nodemon -g
# you can run your code using the following command now and enjoy to restart the program as you changed, this is used for developing purpose. 

nodemon app.js
```
